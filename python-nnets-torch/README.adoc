== Train and Export Transliteration Models

We are teaching transliteration farsi -> latine to neural networks.
For doing it, we use a modern framework: transformers

The code in this repository allows to train and export these Models
into the ONNX format that is in turn used in the production done in Ruby.

Paths would need to be adjusted, as this was a code running google collab.
