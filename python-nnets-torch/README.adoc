=== Train and Export Transliteration Models

We are teaching transliteration farsi -> latine to neural networks.
For doing it, we use a modern framework: transformers

The code in this repository allows to train and export these Models
into the ONNX format that is in turn used in the production done in Ruby.

=== Build ONNX models

python transformers_decomposed_to_onnx.py
