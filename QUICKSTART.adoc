=== Simple Transliteration Model

We implement the following simple transliteration model:

* a -> b, b -> c, c -> d, d -> e, ..., z -> a

The steps below are going to allow us to implement:

1. *design diagram*
2. *diagram based code*
  * generate code
  * run tests
2. *build transliteration data*
3. *neural network model*
  * train model
  * export model to onnx
4. *run ruby code*

=== Design Diagram

We have designed the following diagram with lucidchart:
 https://github.com/interscript/transliteration-learner-from-graphs/blob/main/learn-graph/resources/Model1.0.png[diagram]

It represents a simple strategy that we broke down into 3 steps:

* Transliteration, bundling the steps below
* Preprocessor: clean up chars, lower case, ...
* Mapping: applying the above transformation on characters

A strategy can be thought as a structure through which data "flows"
and gets processed by the various operations represented by the nodes (~functional programming).

In the design, the following conventions are currently supported:

1. *Entries*
    * represent: logic flows starts
    * "Curly Brace Note"
2. *Nodes*
    * represent: computational nodes specifying uniquely some operations
    * "Process", "Decision", "Terminator"
3. *Connections*
  * represent: logical steps
  * "unlabelled directed arrows" "labelled directed arrows"
   (in arbitrary number)

Entries are activated in the following ways:

1. specifying main entry when building code
2. calling entry via node: e.g. "Preprocessor"
3. or calling for a recursion or loop: e.g. "process each word with mapping"

So in the diagram, the computational flow is jumping between subdiagrams.

=== Transliteration Code Generation

Diagram designs on lucidchart can be exported as csv.


[source,sh]
----
# going to learn-graph repo.
cd learn-graph
# install deps
julia packageInstall.jl
julia train.jl --path-lucidchart-csv resources/FullDemo.csv --brain-entry transliteration --path-model resources/FullDemo.dat
----

The code should output a list of warning messages:


===== Code Snippets Implementation

===== Run Tests and transliteration


=== Neural networks

===== Generate Transliteration Data
===== Train Neural Networks
===== Export Neural Networks to Onnx

=== Run ruby Code
